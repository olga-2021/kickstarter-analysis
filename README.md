# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project
In this project I will be using excel. I will create two analyses: outcomes based on goals and outcomes based on launch date.

### Purpose
The purpose of this analysis is to evaluate how different campaigns fared in relation to their launch dates and their funding goals. I this investigation I’ll visualize campaign outcomes based on their launch dates and their funding goals. 

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date
In order to perform this analysis, I used pivot table to visualize campaign outcomes base on launch date. A timeline chart from the pivot table has been created to visualize the relationship between outcomes and launch date. The timeline chart demonstrates the number of successful, failed, or canceled projects by month.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Goals
In this analysis I will examine the percentage of successful, failed, and canceled plays based on the funding goal amount. I have created a timeline chart in order to visualize relationship between the goal-amount and the percentage of successful, failed, or canceled projects.

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered
I found that using the regular code for COUNTIFS function for each cell is time consuming, so I found a shortcut. I’ve created 2 additional columns with variables (please check the excel sheet file column A and B), and instead of typing every single time a new condition in the formula, I just selected the previously created cell with the necessary variable. 

## Results

- What are two conclusions you can draw about the Outcomes based on Launch Date?
According to the Theater outcomes based on launch date timeline chart I can point out that the most successful month to launch a campaign is May. There were registered 111 successful campaigns. Also, we can notice on the graph that the less successful month to launch a campaign is December. There were successfully launched only 37 campaigns. 

- What can you conclude about the Outcomes based on Goals?
The most authentic is to set up a goal of less than $1000 or greater $50000. For the goal which is less than $1000 there is a rate of 71% successful outcomes, 25% are failed, and 4% have been cancelled. For the goal of more than $50000 has been registered a rate of 81% successful outcomes, no failed outcomes have been registered, and only 17% have been canceled. The most ineffective is to set up a goal from $45000 to $49999. For this goal has been registered the lowest successful rate which represent 17% only, with the highest cancelled rate of 51%, and a significative failed rate that represents 31%.
